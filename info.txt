JavaScript
--------------------------------------------------------------
- var has default value is undefined
- never use undefined for initializing a var
- printing var before assignment will return 'undefined'
  but if var is not even declared, it will give an error.
- function can be called anywhere irrespective of declaration
- JavaScript is asynchronous when apicalls or data calls are involved
  synchronous when there is no waiting involved
- JS has dynamic type recognition. Latest type of assigned value
  decides the current type of the variable
- paranthesis cannot cannot statement, only expressions
- methods are within object, functions are outside object
------------------------------------------------------------------
- synchronous - waiting for one request to complete before taking
                 other requests
- asynchronous - Parallely serving multiple requests at same time
------------------------------------------------------------------

Hoisting 
-----------------------------------------
- execution engine scans the entire code
- assigns memory to the variables and functions
- return appropriate results

Functions
-------------------------------------------
- returns undefined if return value is not explicitly mentioned


Anonymous Functions
--------------------------------------------
- function with no name of its own
- this function is assigned to a variables
